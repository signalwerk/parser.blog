S: Once you start to learn a programming language you usually do an exercice that's called 'Hello World'. And this is probably our own «Hello World» warm up in front of a bigger audience. But hey John! Please explain to me what it is for you?
J: oh gosh... Where to start? For me it's probably a format where I have a chance to hear storys of a recent history. But I would like to forward that question to our producer. Take it away Stefan.
N: Thank you John and Sara. We plan to produce a podcast where we put a spotlight on the recent history of computers. We wrap historical facts about commmunicating technology. In short episodes we talk about the history to hopefully understand the future.
S: The parser is a computer generated podcast that is written in text and output for you as audio. 
J: If you like the format, hear mistakes or have suggestions for improvement, please visit our website and comment. We understand the format in an itterative way.
