S: This is our warm up as a 'Hello World' in front of a bigger audience. We're looking forward to develop a audio format that shows us backgrounds to technologys we nowadays take for granted. But hey John! *Please* tell me what it is for you?
J: **oh gosh** Where to _start_? For me it's a format to hear storys of a recent history. A history that I have not always been part of but still it connects to me and my life. But I would like to forward that question to our producer. Take it away Stefan.
N: *Thank you* __John__ and Sara. We plan to produce a podcast where we put a spotlight on the recent history of computers. We wrap up historical facts about commmunicating technology and in short episodes we talk about the history to hopefully understand the future.
S: The parser is a computer generated production that is written in text and output for you as audio. 
J: If you like the format, hear mistakes or have suggestions for improvement, please visit our website and comment. We understand this podcast in an itterative way.
