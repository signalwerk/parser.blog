## First Start

Today was the «official» kick-off of the first season of my podcast. I started in the context of a workshop at [Zurich University of the Arts](https://www.zhdk.ch/) with presenting the concept of my production «parser».  
One side was the content itself but the other was also a the technical challanges and the media perception.  



### Example

To show the power of the media I created a simple example with fully generated audio. The audio is generated from a text file and includes swiss german and different english actents and tones.

<figure>
    <audio
        controls
        src="/media/2022-02-03-first-start/hello.mp3">
            Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
    <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
