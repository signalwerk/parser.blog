# 1. **mp3 and napster** – my donkey is stronger than your major label


J: **This** *is* __parser__
S: A **podcast** about *the first* 100 years of __the internet__

N: In this episode we have a look at a file format called <say-as interpret-as="characters">mp3</say-as> that changed distribution and business models of music forever
--
J: Sarah, why do we talk about a file format? Isn't the brief history of digital files over? When looking at current mobile devices, we bareley have to deal with files at all. It's all about *cloud* nowadays.
S: Thank you John. I see two questions here; first, what is a file format used for? Second, what is the purpose of this one specific format we speak today about?
S: Let me start with the todays main actor: <say-as interpret-as="characters">mp3</say-as>. Broadly described it is a file format that is used to store music or more general sounds. While in todays world an end use often don't handle with files too much anymore I can guarantee you that this format is still in wide use. If you watch a movie or lisen music on a streaming service, chances are high you will find this audio format – or one of its successor – in use. And here we link to the second part of your question; what is the purpose? In general we can say the format is used to transfer as much sound in as few bytes as possible. 
J: So it is about saving storage on a server or my mobile?
S: Yes, it is. But we are also talking about transfer speed. Let's imagine you start a song from your streaming plattform. If you hit the play button you don't wanna wait forever before the track starts.
J: right
S: So by reducing the file size the the transfer takes less time and you can listen to the sound earlier and don't need to wait in silence. 
J: I see. But when you say it's a small filesize – why was it big in the first place?
S: Oh. I never saw it that way arround. Let us step back in history. Not all the way back to vinyl but where sound started to be digital for end user. 
S: In <say-as interpret-as="date" format="y">1982</say-as> the Digital Audio Compact Disc – <say-as interpret-as="characters">cd</say-as> – was released. It was a physical medium used to store audio. it was – as the name indicates – small. But the compact was referencing the dimension. To have a high fidelity while consuming your music the audio needs a lot of data. The Audio CD was storing this in a very general and uncompressed format. No matter if you record a noisy machine or a soft piano, the audio is stored in the same way.
J: Sounds like I would have approached the task of recording and storing audio?
S: That's the first thoth every engeneer would have. You sample an audio in tiny impulses and store this information. But the perception of sound is not the same as the actual sound. For example humens are verry bad with differenciating high pitched sounds. Or you don't hear certain nuances of a sound when shortly before there was a loud sound. And if you know how where we don't hear nuances you can reduce the amount of data you need to store.
J: That sounds complicated
S: Right. And it has to do with our perception and not only with solving a technical task.
J: And here the <say-as interpret-as="characters">mp3</say-as> comes in?
S: Right! The «Moving Picture Experts Group» is an alliance of working groups that have been thinkering on the standardization of the audio and video formats. In December 1988 the Working Group called for an audio coding standard and 14 suggestions from the audio industry, telecommunications companues and research organization were submitted.
J: 14 Standards? That doesn't sound like a standard, thats wild west!
S: No, no. Those were just drafs and ideas for further research. The standardisation progress then started.
J: Sounds like long discussions.
S: Exactly. It took a few years before under the guidance of the Fraunhofer Society in <say-as interpret-as="date" format="y">1992</say-as> the finalised standard was released.

S: Karlheinz Brandenburg was in the lead of this effort and his codec was superior over others. 
J: So there were a lot of people working on the same problem but he was the one who was able to solve it.
S: Yes, he was. He constantly tested during the development his progress with statistical methods and of course he was a critical listener himself. He was repeatingly listening to the encoded audio of 'Tom's Diner' a Suzane Vega Song where the subtle voice was a good instrument to judge the quality degredation in an approachable way.
N: Let me jump in here. 
S: go for it
N: If you wonder about that song check out our shownotes where you will find a link to the song and more information about the topic in genera. 
N: But please continue 
J: We heared now from Sarah how <say-as interpret-as="characters">mp3</say-as> came alive. But we heared in the intro that this also influenced the music industry. How come?
S: Well.. To show the industry how to use the codec, the standardization body put together a sample program that converts music to <say-as interpret-as="characters">mp3</say-as> files. It was not Fraunhofer's intention to use this codec for real use but a nifty activist and programmer
N: I think you are try to avoid the over used term hacker.. 
S: anyway – this anonymous person gained access to the codec and was then able to create and publish a converter. With it people were able to convert music files ripped from <say-as interpret-as="characters">CD</say-as> to compact and small files. 
J: What for? Why do I need small files when I already have the <say-as interpret-as="characters">CD</say-as>?
S: The average household in the western world became more and more connected with the internet. The global data network that previously was mainly connecting institutions and universities.
J: I see where that leads to. Instead of sharing a <say-as interpret-as="characters">CD</say-as> in my local peer group people started to share the files on the global internet.
S: Yes. And that was not legal at all. People downloaded large amout of music from decentralized sharing plattforms like Napstar or <say-as interpret-as="characters">e</say-as>Mule.
J: People helped out with new music? Sounds like the music industry was not amused.
S: Thats exactly the case. Before the sharing started on decentralized plattforms they had a chance to shut down servers where people uploaded <say-as interpret-as="characters">mp3</say-as> files. But with the new distribution model everyone was basically able to share and download and the music industry was not able to stop it.
J: But today we don't do it that way anymore? Apparently they found a way to stop it.
S: Yes and no. Of course they tried to do some show cases in court to spread fear among others doing the same and probably stopping. But I think more important was the fact that music became accessible on a legal way on the internet. Stefan you remember that time.
N: Yes I do. Before the year <say-as interpret-as="date" format="y">2012</say-as> I was one of the hoarders of music. I kept a collection on my harddrive and had to organize my favorites to later find them again. 
S: What happened <say-as interpret-as="date" format="y">2012</say-as>?
N: That was the year I signed up for my first streaming service for music. All of a sudden I was able to search, find and listen to music in a seamless way. That was so liberating and I had no problems with paying a few dollars each moth to get the service.
S: Thats exactly what happened to many of the former pirates. They started to listen to streaming services and were willing to pay if they don't have to becaome illegal and if the convinience is right. 
J: Oh. How did the music industry came up with that idea?
S: They didn't. Young tech companies were the ones who started to build streaming services and find sustainable business models. And of course; <say-as interpret-as="characters">mp3</say-as> was the fist choice for them when they had to transfer music. It was already esablished and very robust.
J: Thank you Sarah. Did we miss something?
S: There is a lot more to say. But it's not our last talk. I'm sure we will come back to related topics in one of the following episodes.
N: Let's wrap it up here. Thank you Sarah and John for your time.
