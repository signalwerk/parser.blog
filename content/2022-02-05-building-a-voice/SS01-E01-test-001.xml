<voice name="en-US-JennyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="assistant" ><prosody rate="3%" pitch="-1%" volume="60">Karlheinz Brandenburg was in the lead of this effort, and his codec was superior over others.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-GB-RyanNeural"><prosody rate="0%" pitch="-2%" volume="60">So there were many people working on the same problem, but he was the one who was able to solve it.</prosody></voice>
<voice name="en-US-JennyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="assistant" ><prosody rate="3%" pitch="-1%" volume="60">Yes, he was. He constantly tested during the development his progress with statistical methods, and of course, he was a critical listener himself. He was repeating listen to the encoded audio of 'Tom's Diner' a Suzane Vega Song where the subtile voice was a good instrument to judge the quality degradation in an approachable way.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-US-GuyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="newscast" ><prosody rate="5%" pitch="0%" volume="60">Let me jump in here.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-US-JennyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="assistant" ><prosody rate="3%" pitch="-1%" volume="60">go for it</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-US-GuyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="newscast" ><prosody rate="5%" pitch="0%" volume="60">If you wonder about that song, check out our show notes where you will find a link to the song and more information about the topic in genera.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-US-GuyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="newscast" ><prosody rate="5%" pitch="0%" volume="60">But please continue</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-GB-RyanNeural"><prosody rate="0%" pitch="-2%" volume="60">We heard now from Sarah how <say-as interpret-as="characters">mp3</say-as> came alive. But we also got in the intro that this also influenced the music industry. How come?</prosody></voice>
<voice name="en-US-JennyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="assistant" ><prosody rate="3%" pitch="-1%" volume="60">Well.. To show the industry how to use the codec, the standardization body put together a sample program that converts music to <say-as interpret-as="characters">mp3</say-as> files. It was not Fraunhofer's intention to publish this codec for real use, but a nifty activist and programmer found the code nevertheless.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-US-GuyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="newscast" ><prosody rate="5%" pitch="0%" volume="60">Are you trying to avoid the overused term hacker?</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-US-JennyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="assistant" ><prosody rate="3%" pitch="-1%" volume="60">anyway – this anonymous person gained access to the source code and was then able to create and publish a converter. With it, people were able to convert large music files ripped from <say-as interpret-as="characters">CD</say-as> to small <say-as interpret-as="characters">mp3</say-as> files.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-GB-RyanNeural"><prosody rate="0%" pitch="-2%" volume="60">What for? Why do I need small files when I already have the <say-as interpret-as="characters">CD</say-as>?</prosody></voice>
<voice name="en-US-JennyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="assistant" ><prosody rate="3%" pitch="-1%" volume="60">The average household in the western world became at the end of the last millenium more and more connected with the internet. The global data network that previously was mainly connecting institutions and universities.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-GB-RyanNeural"><prosody rate="0%" pitch="-2%" volume="60">I see where that leads to. Instead of sharing a <say-as interpret-as="characters">CD</say-as> in my local peer group, people started to share the files on the global internet.</prosody></voice>
<voice name="en-US-JennyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="assistant" ><prosody rate="3%" pitch="-1%" volume="60">Yes. And that was not legal at all. People downloaded large amount of music from decentralized sharing platforms like napster or <say-as interpret-as="characters">e</say-as>Mule.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-GB-RyanNeural"><prosody rate="0%" pitch="-2%" volume="60">People helped out with new music? Sounds like the music industry was not amused.</prosody></voice>
<voice name="en-US-JennyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="assistant" ><prosody rate="3%" pitch="-1%" volume="60">Thats exactly the case. Before the sharing started on decentralized platforms they had a chance to shut down servers where people uploaded <say-as interpret-as="characters">mp3</say-as> files. But with the new distribution model everyone was basically able to share and download and the music industry was not able to stop it.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-GB-RyanNeural"><prosody rate="0%" pitch="-2%" volume="60">But today, we don't do it that way anymore? Apparently, they found a way to stop it.</prosody></voice>
<voice name="en-US-JennyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="assistant" ><prosody rate="3%" pitch="-1%" volume="60">Yes and no. Of course, they tried to do some showcases in court to spread fear among others. But I think more important was the fact that music became accessible on a legal way on the internet. Stefan, you remember that time.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-US-GuyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="newscast" ><prosody rate="5%" pitch="0%" volume="60">Yes, I do. Before the year <say-as interpret-as="date" format="y">2012</say-as> I was one of the hoarders of music. I kept a collection on my hard drive and had to organize my favorites to later find them again.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-US-JennyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="assistant" ><prosody rate="3%" pitch="-1%" volume="60">What happened <say-as interpret-as="date" format="y">2012</say-as>?</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-US-GuyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="newscast" ><prosody rate="5%" pitch="0%" volume="60">That was the year I signed up for my first streaming service for music. All of a sudden, I was able to search, find and listen to music in a seamless way. That was so liberating, and I had no problems with paying a few dollars each moth to get the service.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-US-JennyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="assistant" ><prosody rate="3%" pitch="-1%" volume="60">That's exactly what happened to many of the former pirates. They started to listen to streaming services and were willing to pay. They wanted to avoid becoming illegal, and the convenience factor was just unbeatable.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-GB-RyanNeural"><prosody rate="0%" pitch="-2%" volume="60">Oh. How did the music industry come up with that idea?</prosody></voice>
<voice name="en-US-JennyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="assistant" ><prosody rate="3%" pitch="-1%" volume="60">They didn't. Young tech companies were the ones who started to build streaming services and find sustainable business models. And of course; <say-as interpret-as="characters">mp3</say-as> was the first choice for them when they had to transfer music. It was already established and very robust.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-GB-RyanNeural"><prosody rate="0%" pitch="-2%" volume="60">Thank you, Sarah. Did we miss something?</prosody></voice>
<voice name="en-US-JennyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="assistant" ><prosody rate="3%" pitch="-1%" volume="60">There is a lot more to say. But it's not our last talk. I'm sure we will come back to related topics in one of the following episodes.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
<voice name="en-US-GuyNeural"><mstts:express-as style="newscast" ><prosody rate="5%" pitch="0%" volume="60">Let's wrap it up here. Thank you, Sarah and John for your time.</prosody></mstts:express-as></voice>
