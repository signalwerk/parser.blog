# Naming the thing

## Background
Today I attended the [Digital Arts Festival](https://web.archive.org/web/20211027202133/https://www.da-z.net/) and while listening to clicking noises and pixelated animations of several artists, I thought about the name and specifics of my produciton. I also had the chance to do first reasearch about the generators.


# Decision

```component
id: #title
decision: The Podcast is called «parser»
acceptance-criteria: A title is for the podcast is found
context: Since the podcast will use many parsers to get from a text-represenation to an audio-file and since I just love to write parser I came to the conclusion to name the podcast «parser»
consequences:
    - #subtitle: A subtitle is found that explains the purpose of the podcast.
status: done
```

## Research
* [jsfx: Easy Audio Effects](https://egonelbre.com/project/jsfx/) could be used for intro
* [SoX − Sound eXchange](http://sox.sourceforge.net/sox.html) could be used to mix/compose the episodes
* [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) tool to generate sound
* [Basic Musical Keyboard](https://github.com/keithwhor/audiosynth) to learn more about the sound generation
